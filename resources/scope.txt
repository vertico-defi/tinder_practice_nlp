2) What information you need (requirements & scope)
A. User scenarios

Define 3–5 scenarios that your chatbot must handle:

Cold open from a match with a short bio

Reviving a stalled conversation

Suggesting a low-pressure first date

Handling rejection politely

Navigating boundaries (e.g., “not comfortable with that”)

B. Conversation “skills” you will coach

Pick a small, defensible set (5–8) that can be measured:

Engagement (asks questions, responds to details)

Relevance (references profile/context)

Tone (friendly, respectful, not pushy)

Clarity (short, coherent, low ambiguity)

Empathy (acknowledges feelings)

Safety/boundaries (no harassment/sexual pressure)

Style control (playful vs. serious)

C. Persona design for the “practice partner”

Define persona parameters (so the simulator isn’t random):

Conversation style: dry / warm / playful / shy / direct

Interest topics: fitness, art, gaming, travel, etc.

Responsiveness: short replies vs. long replies

Boundaries: conservative vs. flirty (within safe limits)

D. Data strategy (this matters for NLP grading)

You have three viable routes—choose one based on course expectations:

Synthetic data (most feasible)

Use LLM-generated dialogues with controlled personas and labels (tone, engagement, boundary-handling).

Pros: fast, controllable, privacy-safe.

Cons: less “real-world messy.”

Public conversational datasets (not Tinder-specific)

Use open dialogue corpora to fine-tune style/flow, then adapt with prompts/rules.

Pros: academically clean.

Cons: domain mismatch (dating chat is short, informal).

Small original dataset (high risk, IRB/privacy)

Only if you can do consented collection or anonymized logs with strict ethics.

For most capstones, I’d avoid this unless your program has a clear ethics pipeline.

E. Ethical and safety requirements (you should explicitly include these)

Do not encourage harassment, coercion, or deception.

Provide boundary-respecting suggestions.

Avoid sexual content guidance if it becomes explicit, and block disallowed content.

Disclose: “Practice simulator; not guaranteed to improve real-world outcomes.”
